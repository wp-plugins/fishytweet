Adds a "Tweet this" link to each post.

== Description ==

Adds a link to each post that points the user to Twitter.com. Before the redirect, the URL for the actual post is sent to
Tinyurl.com and the tinyurl-ified URL is used as an argument to Twitter.com thus putting it in the status field when the
page loads.

The anchor text and its title attribute are configurable under Settings.

== Installation ==

Upload the folder to your plugins folder and activate it. See the Settings to customize the text.
